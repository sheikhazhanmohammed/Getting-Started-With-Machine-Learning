### A basic guide to get you started with Machine Learning in Python

### Basics of Python
Feel free 
Before we start, I'd suggest you install Anaconda along with Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook, as it is the best suited package manager for Python. You can install Anaconda from: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Start with the basic syntax of Python from w3schools. I have enclosed a few links of the important Functions and Datastructures you might be using:
- Syntax- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp
- Variables- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp
- Datatypes- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp
- Lists- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp
- Tuples- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp
- Dictionaries- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp
- Conditional Statements- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp
- Loops- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp
- Lambda Functions- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp
- Arrays- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_arrays.asp
- Classes- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp

Once you're done with the basics of Python, you should start with some basic data analysis. Remember that visualization of your data plays a very important role when it comes to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Here are a few resources to help you with Data visualization:

# Getting-Started-With-Machine-Learning
### A basic guide to get you started with Machine Learning in Python

### Basics of Python
Feel free 
Before we start, I'd suggest you install Anaconda along with Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook, as it is the best suited package manager for Python. You can install Anaconda from: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Start with the basic syntax of Python from w3schools. I have enclosed a few links of the important Functions and Datastructures you might be using:
- Syntax- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp
- Variables- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp
- Datatypes- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp
- Lists- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp
- Tuples- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp
- Dictionaries- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp
- Conditional Statements- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp
- Loops- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp
- Lambda Functions- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp
- Arrays- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_arrays.asp
- Classes- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp

Once you're done with the basics of Python, you should start with some basic data analysis. Remember that visualization of your data plays a very important role when it comes to Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Here are a few resources to help you with Data visualization:
- using matplotlib- https://youtu.be/czQO1_GEEos?list=PLZoTAELRMXVPBTrWtJkn3wWQxZkmTXGwe
- using seaborn 1- https://youtu.be/UsglokDLa2o?list=PLZoTAELRMXVPBTrWtJkn3wWQxZkmTXGwe
- using seaborn 2- https://youtu.be/XezfbWlEVwE?list=PLZoTAELRMXVPBTrWtJkn3wWQxZkmTXGwe
- Kaggle notebook1- https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/data-visualization-using-matplotlib
- Kaggle notebook2- https://www.kaggle.com/jsaguiar/exploratory-analysis-with-seaborn
- Kaggle notebook3- https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/data-visualization-using-matplotlib

Data visualization is one of the basic steps when it comes to Machine Learning. The next topic is EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis. The attached notebooks cover most of the aspects of EDA:
- https://www.kaggle.com/ekami66/detailed-exploratory-data-analysis-with-python
- https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-1-exploratory-data-analysis-with-pandas
- https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python

This pretty much clears up all the basics you will need for machine learning.
